This is a simple web application that demonstrates two basic functionalities:
1. A Dark/Light mode switch.
2. A counter that increments and decrements on button clicks.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for both light and dark modes.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the mode switch and counter.
